# Access Control Service (ACS) Samples

## Sample application

### Quick start

To get going, run:

```bash
$ cd spring-mvc-api && ./provision.sh
```

This will walk you through setting up, pushing, and running integration tests on the sample application.

If you're behind a proxy, [first set related environment variables](spring-mvc-api/README.md#setting-proxies-optional).

### Documentation

For more information on how the sample application works or, more generally, how to use the ACS service to authorize certain resources, refer to [`spring-mvc-api/README.md`](spring-mvc-api/README.md).

## Support

General documentation about ACS is available [here](https://www.predix.io/docs/#IGyNp2eM) and API-specific documentation is available [here](https://www.predix.io/services/service.html?id=1180).
